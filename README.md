# Virtual machine image for artifact evaluation

This repository contains the virtual machine image for running artifact evaluation experiments.
The image contains, in an already configured form: Blockaid, the three applications, and experiment scripts.

To run the experiments, see [these instructions](https://github.com/blockaid-project/artifact-eval/).
You **might not** need to download this VM image to do so.
